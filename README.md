1. Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
### Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
 
-YES 
 
2. MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
### Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
-YES
 
 
3. Web API: (Yes/No)

-YES


Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:

1.Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
 
### Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

- The benefits of this approach include the separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

2. Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
### Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

-YES. Onion Architecture offers numerous advantages, but its initial implementation can be challenging due to its steep learning curve and the need for strict architectural adherence.




Web API:
 
 
1. Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
### Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 
- MVC applications handle server-side HTML views and user interactions, while Web APIs provide endpoints for data exchange and communication between systems or applications, typically using JSON or XML.
 
 
2. Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
### Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

- Traditional MVC applications may face performance issues due to frequent page refreshes or complex data exchanges, leading to increased server load, slower response times, and scalability issues. Utilizing Web APIs can alleviate these concerns.
